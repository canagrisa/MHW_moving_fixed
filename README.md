# Rosselló et al. (2023) Code Repository

This repository provides all the code required for data downloading, preprocessing, and analysis to generate the results (figures and tables) presented in Rosselló et al. (2023). The code relies heavily on two Python packages specifically developed for this purpose:

- [**CMIP_data_retriever**](https://github.com/canagrisa/CMIP_data_retriever): A package for downloading CMIP model data relevant to the region and period of study.
- [**MHW_metrics**](https://github.com/canagrisa/MHW_metrics): A package for computing Marine Heatwave (MHW) metrics on netCDF4 files.


# Description of the Repository


The raw satellite and model data is not included in the repository, as it would be too heavy. Code to download it the rellevant raw satellite and model data for the study. The results of the study are included, as well as the code to regenerate them.
