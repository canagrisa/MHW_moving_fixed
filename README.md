# Rosselló et al. (2023) Code Repository

This repository provides all the code required for data downloading, preprocessing, and analysis to generate the results (figures and tables) presented in Rosselló et al. (2023). The code relies heavily on two Python packages specifically developed for this purpose:

- [**CMIP_data_retriever**](https://github.com/canagrisa/CMIP_data_retriever): A package for downloading CMIP model data relevant to the region and period of study.
- [**MHW_metrics**](https://github.com/canagrisa/MHW_metrics): A package for computing Marine Heatwave (MHW) metrics on netCDF4 files.


# Description of the Repository

This repository provides the code and resources needed to reproduce the results, figures, and tables in the Rosselló et al. (2023) article. The repository is organized into the following folders and files:

- `code/`
    - `data_retrieve/`: Code to download raw data for the study.
        - For model data, the CMIP_data_retriever package is used.
        - For satellite data, data is downloaded using CMEMS API calls (requires a CMEMS account).
    - `preprocessing/`: Code for preprocessing the raw data, including data cleaning, filtering, and transformation.
    - `figures/`: Code to generate figures used in the article.
    - `tables/`: Code to generate tables used in the article.
    - `utils.py`: Utility functions used throughout the repository.
    - `plot_utils.py`: Utility functions for plotting and visualizations.
    - `test.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate and test the code in the repository.
    - `__pycache__/`: Cache folder generated by Python when importing modules.


<!-- - **Data Downloading**: The raw satellite and model data are not included in the repository due to their large size. However, we provide code to download the relevant raw satellite and model data for the study using the `CMIP_data_retriever` package.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The code for preprocessing the raw data, including data cleaning, filtering, and transformation, is included in this repository.
- **Data Analysis**: The code for performing data analysis, such as calculating MHW metrics using the `MHW_metrics` package, is provided.
- **Results**: The results of the study, including the generated data files, are included in the repository.
- **Figures and Tables**: The code to regenerate the figures and tables present in the article is provided, as well as the final versions of the figures and tables. -->
